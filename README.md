# Hieroglyphy

A tool for converting JavaScript strings, numbers, and scripts to an `eval`able sequence of `()[]{}+!` characters.
Such bizarre strings are very much longer than the source code from which they were generated, but they are still perfectly executable.

## Update

This utility has been converted to an ES6 module and significantly optimised.

## Usage and installation

Just clone the repo or download `hieroglyphy.js` file and include that module in your larger project.

## TODO

* Browser tests need to be updated
* More exhastive testing would probably be a good idea...
